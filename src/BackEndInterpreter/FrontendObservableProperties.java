/**
 * This is the main part of my masterpiece. Since the TurtleProperties is accessed by both the front end and back end,
 * a lot of the ObservableProperties methods need to be public for front end to edit and change.
 * However, not all the public methods that the backend uses need to be accessed by the front end such as
 * NewLine Property and image visible property. Therefore, I created an interface that ObservableProperties implements
 * and that the front end will access which you can see in GUIDisplay, that only has the public methods that
 * the front end only needs. That way, ObservableProperties is much more encapsulated and hidden from the front end.
